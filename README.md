# 🧠 Deep Learning from Scratch: MNIST Classifier in NumPy

This project implements a complete deep learning pipeline to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset — **from scratch using only NumPy**, without relying on high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

It covers everything from loading the dataset to training, evaluating, and experimenting with different architectures, activation functions, and loss functions.
